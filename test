## 5. Literature Review

### 5.1 RESTful API Design

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources. This project follows REST principles, ensuring that API endpoints are intuitive and follow standard conventions.

Key principles applied:
- Stateless communication
- Resource-based URLs
- Standard HTTP methods
- JSON data format
- Proper HTTP status codes

### 5.2 Spring Boot Framework

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that simplifies the development of production-ready applications. It provides auto-configuration, reducing the need for manual configuration. Spring Boot's embedded server capabilities allow for easy deployment and testing.

Advantages utilized in this project:
- Rapid application development
- Auto-configuration
- Embedded server support
- Production-ready features
- Extensive ecosystem

### 5.3 JWT Authentication

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provide a stateless authentication mechanism. Unlike session-based authentication, JWT tokens contain all necessary information, eliminating the need for server-side session storage. This makes JWT ideal for scalable, distributed systems.

Benefits in this project:
- Stateless authentication
- Scalability
- Cross-domain support
- Self-contained tokens
- Industry standard

### 5.4 Database Design Principles

Proper database design is crucial for application performance and data integrity. This project follows normalization principles and establishes proper relationships between entities. The use of JPA/Hibernate simplifies database operations while maintaining flexibility.

Design principles applied:
- Normalization
- Proper relationships
- Index optimization
- Transaction management
- Data integrity constraints

### 5.5 Security Best Practices

Security is paramount in e-commerce systems. This project implements multiple security layers:
- Password encryption using BCrypt
- JWT token validation
- Role-based access control
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention through JPA

## 11. Security Implementation

### 11.1 Authentication Flow

The authentication flow follows these steps:

1. **Registration:**
   - Client sends registration request with user details
   - Server validates input data
   - Server checks email uniqueness
   - Server encrypts password using BCrypt
   - Server creates user and cart
   - Server generates JWT token
   - Server returns token to client

2. **Login:**
   - Client sends login request with credentials
   - Server validates credentials using AuthenticationManager
   - Server generates JWT token
   - Server returns token to client

3. **Authenticated Requests:**
   - Client includes JWT token in Authorization header
   - JwtAuthenticationFilter intercepts request
   - Filter extracts token from header
   - Filter validates token signature and expiration
   - Filter loads user details
   - Filter sets authentication in security context
   - Request proceeds to controller

### 11.2 JWT Implementation

**Token Structure:**
JWT tokens consist of three parts separated by dots:
- Header: Algorithm and token type
- Payload: Claims (email, issued at, expiration)
- Signature: HMAC SHA256 signature

**Token Generation:**
- Uses jjwt library
- Sets subject as user email
- Sets issued at time
- Sets expiration (24 hours)
- Signs with secret key

**Token Validation:**
- Extracts token from Authorization header
- Parses token to extract claims
- Validates signature
- Checks expiration
- Verifies user exists

### 11.3 Password Security

**BCrypt Hashing:**
- Uses BCryptPasswordEncoder
- Automatic salt generation
- Adaptive hashing (10 rounds)
- One-way encryption

**Password Validation:**
- Minimum 6 characters required
- Validated using Jakarta Validation
- No password complexity requirements (can be enhanced)

### 11.4 Role-Based Access Control

**Role Implementation:**
- Roles stored as enum in User entity
- CUSTOMER: Standard user access
- ADMIN: Full system access

**Access Control:**
- Method-level security using @PreAuthorize
- Role checks in SecurityConfig
- Endpoint protection based on roles

**Protected Endpoints:**
- Admin endpoints require ADMIN role
- Cart and order endpoints require authentication
- Product viewing is public
- Product modification requires ADMIN role

### 11.5 Security Configuration

**Security Filter Chain:**
- Public endpoints: /api/auth/**, /api/products/**, /h2-console/**
- Protected endpoints: All others require authentication
- Admin endpoints: /api/admin/** requires ADMIN role

**CORS Configuration:**
- Allows all origins (can be restricted in production)
- Supports all HTTP methods
- Allows all headers

**Session Management:**
- Stateless session management
- No server-side session storage
- JWT tokens handle authentication state
